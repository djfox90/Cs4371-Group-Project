# Cs4371-Group-Project
In the file labels csproject will have the code to simulate a database that has its data distributed over some number of servers. These servers will be receiving read and write requests for some data that is stored in the database. Some of these servers will be using the SBFT (Simplified Bernoulli-trials) algorithm and the others will be using PBFT (Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm) algorithm. The code will then display the efficiency of both algorithms for the servers presenting the most efficient of the two. The code has a variable block size, as well as a variable rate of incoming requests.
To copy the following code and run the code the user would first need the proper software such as an IDE with the ability to run a c++ file which the code is written in. To easily clone the file you first must locate my GitHub account at https://github.com/djfox90 select repositories then select Cs4371-Group-Project and copy https://github.com/djfox90/Cs4371-Group-Project.git and copy the code to your git bash using the command git clone. It will then display in your documents.
